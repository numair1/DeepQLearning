In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied to developing intelligent video game agents in the ATARI game framework. In this paper, we apply Deep Q Learning to develop optimal dynamic treatment regimes by simulating a cohort of diabetic patients. The cohort of patients is simulated according to the third wave of Nation Health and Nutrition Survey, and we compare the performance of our Deep Q network against previous approaches that donâ€™t apply Deep Reinforcement Learning. We find the capability of Deep Q Networks to learn non-linear transformations of the input features allows for improved dynamic treatment regimes compared to traditional approaches. Additionally, we study the rate of convergence of these Deep Q Networks and look to validate our proposed method using real patient data from the Electronic Health Record.
